Yes, this is it. The big moment is here.
Let's just get straight to it.

Before anything: get the New Launcher and follow the guide on how to install it.

1) Drag and drop the "network", "server", and "www" folders into Erupe.
If it asks you to overwrite stuff, you're doing the right thing.
2) Clear your INetCache again in "Internet Properties"
3) Open pgadmin4.
4) Rightclick Erupe and open the Query Tool.
5) Drag and drop "SCHEMA.sql" file into the Query Tool field.
6) Press F5
If it gives you "Query returned successfully" then you did it right.
7) Run the server, and enjoy the big snake.

Want to change the subscription?
1) Go back into pgadmin4.
2) Find the users table, and right-click it.
3) View/Edit Data -> All Rows
4) In the new "rights" collumn, you can now set it per user.
[You must only set numbers!]
14 = Hunter Life and EX Course
846 = Hunter Life, EX Course, Premium Course, Assist Course, and N Course
8014 = 846, but also Hunter AidCourse (1.25x damage boost and 70% damage reduction) and N-Boost Course.
